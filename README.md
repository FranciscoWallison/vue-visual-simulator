# vue-visual-simulator
This page was developed in order to allow you to simulate your character costume using a render [API](https://github.com/zhad3/zrenderer).

It's very easy to use, just select the equipments that you want to test.

Credits for images go to Divine-Pride, where they are being pulled.
